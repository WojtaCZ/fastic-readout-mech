# FastIC+ readout mechanical
This repository contains the mechanical files of the FastIC+ readout enclosure. The source files from Fusion 360 are provided aswell as 3D printable exported meshes for the [top](top.3mf) and [bottom](bottom.3mf) parts. The PCB design files for the [readout board](https://github.com/WojtaCZ/fastic-readout-hw) aswell as the [user board](https://github.com/WojtaCZ/fastic-userboard-hw) are available in separate repositories.

## 3D printing recomendation
The two components of the top part of the case can be printed either separately (if only a single material 3D printer is available) or joined, on a multi material printer. To print the parts joined in Cura, one needs to select both of them, right click and select "Merge". If printed separately, the two top components are to be glued together.

## Metal inserts and screws
M2 metal inserts with the length of 3.5 mm and output diameter of 3.5 mm were used in the design. These need to be fitted into the top part.

For all the screws, the M2 hex head with the length of 20mm is considered.
